/*
Serializable interface- 
-The Serializable interface serves as a contract between the class and the Java serialization mechanism. It indicates that the class is designed to be serializable and specifies that the class's fields should be included in the serialization process.
-When a class implements the Serializable interface, it is essentially informing the Java runtime that objects of that class can be converted into a byte stream and then be saved to a file, transferred over a network, or stored in a database. This process is known as serialization.
