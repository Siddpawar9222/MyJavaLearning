/*
 Unicode escape sequence \u000d represents a line feed (LF) character, which is commonly used to indicate the end of a line in text
  means it is equals to 
        //

  In Java, when you write an integer literal with a leading zero, like 012, it's interpreted as an octal (base 8) literal. The digits in octal go from 0 to 7, so 012 in octal is equivalent to 1 * 8^1 + 2 * 8^0, which is 10 in decimal.
