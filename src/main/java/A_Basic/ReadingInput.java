        //Note
//        BufferedReader is synchronous while Scanner is not. BufferedReader        should be used if we are working with multiple threads.
//        BufferedReader has a significantly larger buffer memory than Scanner.
//        The Scanner has a little buffer (1KB char buffer) as opposed to the BufferedReader (8KB byte buffer), but itâ€™s more than enough.
//        BufferedReader is a bit faster as compared to Scanner because the Scanner does the parsing of input data and BufferedReader simply reads a sequence of characters.
