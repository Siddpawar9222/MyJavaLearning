Annotations:
-Annotations are primarily used to provide metadata, configuration, or additional information to classes, methods, fields, or other program elements. 
They don't define any methods or behavior themselves. 
-With Annotations , tools, frameworks, and libraries can understand to perform specific actions or to enable certain behaviors.
-Annotations in Java are like labels that you can attach to your code to provide extra information. These labels help the compiler (the program that turns your code into something the computer can understand) and other tools understand how to treat your code. Think of annotations as sticky notes that you can put on your code to tell the computer or other programmers special things about it. They're not part of the main code logic, but they provide important instructions or metadata.
-Marker interface also does the same task .hence annotations are better replacement for it .
