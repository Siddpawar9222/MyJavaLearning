/*
-Method reference operator :: is used to refer to the methods of functional interface.
-It is compact and easy form of lambda expression.
-Most of the time, we do some operations inside the lambda expression. Sometimes, however, a lambda expression does nothing but call an existing method. In those cases, itâ€™s often clearer to refer to the existing method by name.
-So, whenever you are using a lambda expression to refer to a method, you can also do the same using a method reference. Replace the lambda expression with method reference and it works!
-There are four kinds of method references.
    Reference to static methods.
    Reference to instance methods of particular objects.(Without paramter)
    Reference to an instance method of an arbitrary object of a particular type.(With paramter)
    Reference to a constructor.

 Note :
 paramters of method to be refer must equal to functional interface method paramter.

 In Simple language :
   Method and Constructor References is giving implementation of existing method to functional interface abstract method.
