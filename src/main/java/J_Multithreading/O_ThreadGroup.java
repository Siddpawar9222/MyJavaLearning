/*

Think of a thread group as a container or a category that holds a group of threads together. Just like you can organize files into folders on your computer, you can organize threads into thread groups in Java.

A thread pool is a collection of threads used to execute tasks concurrently.
A thread group is a mechanism for organizing threads into a hierarchical structure for management and monitoring.
