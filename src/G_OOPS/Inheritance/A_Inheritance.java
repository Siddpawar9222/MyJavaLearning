/*
Inheritance :  one class (called the child class or subclass) inherits the properties and methods of another class (called the parent class or superclass). This allows the child class to reuse the code and extend the functionality of the parent class.

A real-world example of inheritance : 
 The relationship between animals and their offspring. In this scenario, the offspring inherit certain traits, characteristics, and behaviors from their parents. For instance, a dog may inherit the coat color, size, and certain behavioral traits from its parents.
 */

/*
//*-->Here comName is variable for Employeee instance which is  different variable than  Company instace .
//*-->since i changed companyInfo parameter, Company class ompanyInfo() will call.

Conclusion: 
 I can Override field and methods in inheritance(Learn Method Overriding first)
