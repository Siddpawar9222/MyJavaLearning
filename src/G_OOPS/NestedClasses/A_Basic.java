Nested Classes : 
Java inner class or nested class is a class that is declared inside the class or interface.

Advantages: 
- Nested classes represent a particular type of relationship that is it can access all the members (data members and methods) of the outer class, including private.
- Nested classes are used to develop more readable and maintainable code because it logically group classes and interfaces in one place only. Increase encapsulation
- Code Optimization: It requires less code to write

Need : 
 If a class is used only within the context of another class and doesn't make sense to be used elsewhere, you can define it as a nested class. This helps to encapsulate helper classes within the scope of the outer class and improves code organization.

Example : 
-In DSA , to create node of LinkedList you used inner class .
-Interface Entry in Map Class



Types : 

A}Non-static nested class (inner class)
   - Member inner class
   - Anonymous inner class
   - Local inner class
b}Static nested class
