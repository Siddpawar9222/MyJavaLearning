First of all ,  disable code runner extension before writing Java program vs code :


Class not found error or java.lang. error :
- File name must be equal to the main class of a function if it is public( If not public program will work).
- Give the correct path in terminal  
--Edit Environment variable (Dont go to Edit Environment variable for your account  )


Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: Student: method 'void <init>()' not found  :
-Try to Change class name 
-Check whether main statement written in proper way or not
-Try to compile program in seprate folder


HashSet cannot be resolved to a type :
close vs code and reopen it or delete file and recreate new file .

- code below infinite while loop hey is unreachable

- if we have to use Scanner class in a code and also below their is any loop or uconditional statement is returned then resource leak problem may occurs
    use try(Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in) 
    Don't write a scanner constructor flash file

-- write bitwise operator correctly 
give the proper space between the variable and the number . Also give the bracket between two operation

--navigate class 
 ctrl + t --> Search class
