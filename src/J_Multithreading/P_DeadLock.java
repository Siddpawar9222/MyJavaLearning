/*
To understand deadlock, let's consider an analogy with two people and two pens. Each person needs both pens to complete their task. Now, imagine the following scenario:


Person A picks up pen 1.
Person B picks up pen 2.
Person A realizes they need pen 2 and tries to pick it up but can't because Person B is holding it.
At the same time, Person B realizes they need pen 1 and tries to pick it up but can't because Person A is holding it.


Now, both people are stuck waiting for the other person to release the pen they need to proceed. This is a deadlock situation because neither person can make progress, and they remain deadlocked indefinitely.
