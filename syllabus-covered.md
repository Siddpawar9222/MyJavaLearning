## Java Basics : 

* Java Basic, editions, features
* JDK vs JRE vs JVM
* JVM architecture
    - classpath, classloader
    -  JVM memory
    -  execution engine (interpreter, JIT compiler, garbage collector) 

## OOPS 
* Introduction, advantages
* terminologies 
   - class 
   - objects 
   - encapsulation
   - abstraction
   - polymorphisms
   - inheritance
   - encapsulation vs abstraction
* variables (instance, global and local)
* methods and recursion
* constructor

## Keywords 
* access modifiers
* static,super,final,extends, abstract,implements, synchronized, volatile, transient

## Encapsulation
* Getters and setters
## Abstraction
* Abstract class
* Interfaces
  - Types
  - Diamond problem
  - Functional interface implementation
## Polymorphisms
* Method overloading
* Varargs
* Method overriding
* static(early binding) and runtime(late binding) polymorphism
* Dynamic Method Dispatch with inheritance, interfaces
* Covariant return type

## Inheritance
* Inheritance Basics and types
* Inheritance with constructors, multilevel inheritance
* Inheritance with methods
* Constructor chaining using this and super keyword
* Inheritance with interfaces

## Others
* Nested Classes
   - non-static class
     - member inner class
     - local inner class
     - anonymous inner class
   - static class
* Reference Variable
* Object class and its method
* Generics
* Reflections
